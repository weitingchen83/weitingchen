My Chinese name is 陳韋廷. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Graduate Institude of Electronic Engineering in National Taiwan University (NTU). My advisor is Prof. Sy-Yen Kuo and I co-work with Prof. Jian-Jiun Ding. I received my Bachelor of Science degree at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in 2016, where I was supervised by Prof. Sheng-Chieh Huang and Ching-Cheng Chuang. I served as exchange student in my senior year at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. I have lead several projects in past three years and I am a dynamic, easy-going, ambitious, open-minded  and optimistic person.
My research interests span the fields of Computational Photography, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning (ML), Signal Processing and Biomedical Singal Processing, particularly image restoration, re-identification, time-frequency analysis and wavelet transform, advanced digital signal processing, and optical imaging (NIRs).
